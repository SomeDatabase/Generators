# Sorority/Fraternity Name Generator
I'm currently working on another story that will have at least one fictional sorority and one fictional fraternity. 

A sorority is a sisterhood, and a fraternity is a brotherhood, though some co-ed fraternities exist. No matter the gender, they follow the same naming convention, which is using greek letters for their names. All of the sororities and fraternities that I have come into contact with use three greek letters for their name, though some use two. Some may also use four. Three seems to be the most common right now though. If you would like to use two or four, it should be easy enough to tweak the code to generate two or four. 

Do a quick Google search to make sure your sorority/fraternity name isn't in use. Otherwise, have fun generating your sorority or fraternity. 

This program uses a list for the greek alphabet. I'll include it here. Otherwise, have fun.
