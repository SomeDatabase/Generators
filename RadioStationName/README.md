# Radio Station Name Generator
A while back, I was working on a story where I needed a name for a fake radio station. It turns out that there are no radio station name generators, so I wrote my own, adapting some code from a program I wrote for a class for this purpose. 

This code will generate a four letter call sign for a radio station. It simply generates random letters, with a fixed start letter. Historically, stations east of the Mississipi start with the letter "W" and stations west of the Missippi have a starting letter of K. My story took place east of the Missippi, so the code has it fixed with the letter W. You can change it rather easily. Millitary stations historically began with N and A, and maybe your game/story/movie/play takes place on an alien planet or something and they have some other naming convention. It should be easy enough to tweak. 

If you are setting your game/story in the real world, and you want to avoid getting sued, the FCC has a [call sign lookup page](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/callsign/mainch.pl) that you can check out. Just generate some names, and keep trying ones you like until you find a combo that works.
